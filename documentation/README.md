## CoreMedia Labs Prototypes

This is a CoreMedia Labs prototype which means it __does not provide a stable API__.
The current implementation won't match the one which will be released for a future CoreMedia workspace.
Therefore, we also don't provide a proper documentation for it.
If you are interested in a custom integration, feel free to contact us!

## Versioning

The release versions of the Searchmetrics Feedback Hub Adapter is matching the version of CoreMedia workspace releases.
E.g. when the CoreMedia workspace has the version __2001.1__, the matching Searchmetrics Feedback Hub Adapter release will have
version __2001.1-X__ where 'X' indicates the release version of the Searchmetrics Feedback Hub Adapter.
